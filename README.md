# Byzantine Textform Robinson-Pierpont 2005

Byzantine Textform Greek New Testament (2005 edition, updated) edited
by Robinson and Pierpont.

The text and its analysis are in the Public Domain.

The text is the one edited by Maurice A. Robinson and William
G. Pierpont, 2005 edition.

The analysis is created and edited by Maurice A. Robinson, and is also
from August 2013.

The union of these two has been produced programmatically by Ulrik
Sandborg-Petersen of Scripture Systems ApS, Denmark.

texts/parsed-unaccented/ : Parsed, Unaccented Byzantine text from
                           Maurice A. Robinson.

texts/accented-unparsed/ : Accented, Unparsed Byzantine text from
                           Maurice A. Robinson via Chilton Publishing.

texts/accented-parsed/   : The union of the above two in one file.  Just
                           the straight text with parse tags, Strong's
                           numbers, and TVM numbers.  Union done by
			   Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen.

The accented, parsed text is just the straight text, with no footnotes
and no margin notes.  The {C} means: Chapter break (also indicating
paragraph break), and {P} means a paragraph break.  The rest should be
fairly straightforward.  If not, feel free to drop me a note (email
address below).


Enjoy!
