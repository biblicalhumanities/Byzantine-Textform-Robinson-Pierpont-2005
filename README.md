The analysis is created and edited by Maurice A. Robinson, and is also
from August 2013.  


The union of these two has been produced programmatically by Ulrik
Sandborg-Petersen of Scripture Systems ApS, Denmark.

texts/parsed-unaccented/ : Parsed, Unaccented Byzantine text from
                           Maurice A. Robinson.

texts/accented-unparsed/ : Accented, Unparsed Byzantine text from
                           Maurice A. Robinson via Chilton Publishing.

texts/accented-parsed/   : The union of the above two in one file.  Just
                           the straight text with parse tags, Strong's
                           numbers, and TVM numbers.  Union done by
			   Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen.

The accented, parsed text is just the straight text, with no footnotes
and no margin notes.  The {C} means: Chapter break (also indicating
paragraph break), and {P} means a paragraph break.  The rest should be
fairly straightforward.  If not, feel free to drop me a note (email
address below).


Enjoy!
